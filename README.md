CI/CD is a method of delivering apps to customers on a frequent basis by introducing automation during the app development stage. Key concepts that emerge from CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is a solution to the problems (aka "integration hell") that new code integration can cause development and operations teams.
CI in CI/CD refers to continuous integration, an automated process for developers, and CD in CI/CD refers to continuous delivery and continuous development.

The reason CI/CD tools are used to ensure proper continous integration that makes fast and reliable delivery possible. A “good” CI/CD tool leverages the team’s current workflow, maximizes automation capabilities, creates a solid CI/CD pipeline, and gives the team the boost it needs to succeed. A few examples of CI/CD tools are Jenkins, circleci, and GitLab. 
Jenkins is an open-source automation server which is a self-contained Java-based program, whereas CircleCi can be integrated with GitHub to create builds. The last example which is GitLab allows you to trigger builds, run tests and deploy code with each commit or push.
