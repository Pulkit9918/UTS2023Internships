CI/CD is a method of delivering apps to customers on a frequent basis by introducing automation during the app development stage. Key concepts that emerge from CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is a solution to the problems (aka "integration hell") that new code integration can cause development and operations teams.
CI in CI/CD refers to continuous integration, an automated process for developers, and CD in CI/CD refers to continuous delivery and continuous development.
